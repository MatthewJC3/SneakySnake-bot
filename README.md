# SneakySnake-bot
This is my discord bot using the discord.py api, aimed to be an personal exploration of using api's and an exploration
into creating my own docker
images. 

If you want to run this yourself, the only necessary file missing from
the github is the .env file, so I could keep my api key safe. 

Just create a .env file, and define 
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your token here"

Thank you for reading! If you have any command suggestions please tell me them!
